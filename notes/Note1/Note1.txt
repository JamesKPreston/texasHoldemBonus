The game is played with a single 52-card deck.
The player makes an Ante wager, plus an optional Bonus bet.
Two hole cards are dealt face down to the player and dealer. The player may look at his own cards.
The player must either fold or make a Flop bet. The Flop bet must be two times the amount of the ante.
Three community cards (the Flop) are dealt.
The player may do nothing or make a Turn bet. The Turn bet must be exactly equal to the ante bet.
A fourth community card is dealt (the Turn).
The player may do nothing or make a River bet. The River bet must be exactly equal to the ante bet.
A fifth community card is dealt (the River).
The player and dealer each make the best five-card hand using any combination of the five community cards and his own two initial hole cards. The higher hand wins.
If the dealer has the higher hand the player will lose all wagers, except possibly the Bonus bet.
If the player has the higher hand the Flop, Turn, and River bets will pay even money. If the player has a straight or higher the Ante bet will also pay even money, otherwise it will push.
If the player and dealer have hands of equal value the the Ante, Flop, Turn, and River bets will all push.
The Bonus bet will pay based only the player's and dealer's initial cards, according to the pay table posted.
